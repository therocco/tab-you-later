# Tab You Later

This is a small Chrome extension I wrote that will allow you to save (or save and close) all of your open tabs to a to-do list.

### Installation

Download package from GitHub (https://github.com/therocco/tab-you-later/archive/master.zip), unzip, and add to Chrome via the `chrome://extension` page.
