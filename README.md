# Tab You Later

This is a small Chrome extension I wrote that will allow you to save (or save and close) all of your open tabs to a to-do list.

### Installation

Download package from GitHub (https://github.com/therocco/tab-you-later/archive/master.zip), unzip, and add to Chrome via the `chrome://extension` page.

### Usage

Right click on any page in Chrome and using the new `Tab You Later` context menu choose whether you want to:

| option              | description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save tabs           | Saves all open tabs to to-do list.                                           |
| Save tabs and close | Saves all open tabs to to-do list and closes all tabs except the active tab. |
